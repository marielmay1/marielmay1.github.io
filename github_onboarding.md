# How to create a personal GitHub page
GitHub is a web application that hosts Git repositories for users as well as organizations. While repositories can be private, 
GitHub really shines in the open source community providing a service for contributors from all over the world to contribute 
to projects, report bugs, and download project artifacts. Not only does GitHub allow you to do all those things but it could even 
be considered to be a social network for code!

Let's get you started! 

### Create a GitHub Account

Your repository has been created!  
Now it is time to add to add some files. You can create one directly on GitHub by clickling on the **creating a new file** link. You could also add a file by creating a file locally.
